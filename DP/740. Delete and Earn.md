*\# [740] **Delete and Earn***

***\#Given an array `nums` of integers, you can perform operations on the array.***

***In each operation, you pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. After, you must delete every element equal to `nums[i] - 1` or `nums[i] + 1`.***

***You start with `0` points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.***

***Example:***

```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.
Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.
9 total points are earned
```

### Solution:

1. 同198——rob房间问题：所有相同元素可以累加，每个元素值+ - 1的元素不能被累加。创建存放所有相同元素累加和的list，遍历该list，同198 间隔一个做一次累加取max操作

\# @lc code=start

```python
class Solution:
    def deleteAndEarn(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        max_num = max(nums)
        total_list = [0] * (max_num + 1)
        # total的list存储的是所有相同元素的累加和
        for item in nums:
            total_list[item] += item
        length = len(total_list)
        first, second = total_list[0], max(total_list[0], total_list[1])
        for i in range(2, length):
            # total的list在遍历时中间隔一个元素 即当前元素的左右元素不能被算做当前的可行方案 必须隔一个取当前最大值 和上一个最大值对比
            first, second = second, max(first + total_list[i], second)
        return second
```
