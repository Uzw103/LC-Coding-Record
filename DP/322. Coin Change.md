*\# [322] **Coin Change***

***\#You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.***

***Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.***

***You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.***

***Example：***

```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

### Solution：

1. 动态规划：dp[i]代表amount=i的情况下最小所需的硬币数量。初始化为无穷大，找到状态转移条件就是：F(2)=min(F(2-1),F(2-2),F(2-5))+1 只与coins中的硬币面额有关。

\# @lc code=start

```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 0
        for coin in coins:
            for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
        return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```
