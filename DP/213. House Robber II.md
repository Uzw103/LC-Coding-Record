*\# [213] **House Robber II***

***\#You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.***

***Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.***

***Example:***

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

### ==Solution:==

1. 动态规划：第一个和最后一个不能同时抢，所以动态规划的状态转移方程为：把环拆成两个数组，一个是从0到n-1，另一个是从1到n，然后返回两个结果最大的。

\# @lc code=start

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        def rob_max(start, end):
            first, second = nums[start], max(nums[start], nums[start + 1])
            for i in range(start + 2, end + 1):
                first, second = second, max(first + nums[i], second)
            return second
        
        length = len(nums)
        if length == 0:
            return 0
        if length <= 3:
            return max(nums)
        return max(rob_max(0, length - 2), rob_max(1, length - 1))
```
