*\# [122] **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II***

***\#You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.***

***Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).***

***Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).***

***Example：***

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

### Solution:

1. **贪心算法**：题目要求**return所有的profit总和**，所以可以当做每天都做买卖然后累加的情况。即**前后连续上涨交易日买卖，否则什么都不做**。相当于前后连续两天 每天都对比下是否值得入手，因为它的**总profit是不变的**，所以可以拆解为*<u>前后两天的贪心</u>*（**==考虑局部最优解的问题==**）

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            temp_profit = prices[i] - prices[i - 1]
            if temp_profit > 0:
                profit += temp_profit
        return profit
```
