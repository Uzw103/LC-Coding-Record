\# [123] **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III**

***\#You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.***

***Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.***

***Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).***

***Example:***

```
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

### ==Solution:==

1. **动态规划**：**只能进行2次**买入卖出操作。定义**4个状态**：`buy1[i], sell1[i], buy2[i], sell2[i]`分别表示在第i天进行该操作可获得的最大利润。每天的4个状态只与它的前一天的状态有关

\# @lc code=start

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # 只能进行两次操作，可以想到在每一天一共有4个状态，第一次买入/卖出；第二次买入/卖出
        # 每一天的状态只与它前一天的状态有关 
        sell1 = sell2 = 0
        buy1 = buy2 = -float('inf')
        for price in prices: 
            buy1 = max(buy1, -price)
            sell1 = max(sell1, buy1 + price)
            buy2 = max(buy2, sell1 - price)
            sell2 = max(sell2, buy2 + price)
        return sell2
```
