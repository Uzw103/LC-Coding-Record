\# [1011] ***Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days***

*\#**Given a list of `weights`， need to `return` a num which could `sum` all the nums in weight in `D` days.*** 

***Example:***

```
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed.
```

### ==Solution:==

1. **二分搜索换边界条件问题：**与875一致，**left和right边界的初始值**需要谨慎确定，不是普通意义上的0和length了。
2. 需要在每次确定一个mid后遍历sum一遍list来看看是否满足day<=D，**==确定左边界==**

```python
class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:
        '''weights中的顺序不能改变，即必须依次逐个遍历，不能随意组合weights'''
        # return船的最小载重量 因此求的是左边界问题
        left, right = max(weights), sum(weights)
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            temp_sum = 0
            day = 1
            for weight in weights:
                temp_sum += weight
                if temp_sum > mid:
                    day += 1
                    temp_sum = weight
            
            if day > D:
                left = mid + 1
            elif day <= D:
                right = mid
        return left
```
