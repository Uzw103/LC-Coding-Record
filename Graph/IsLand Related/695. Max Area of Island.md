\# [695] ***Max Area of Island***

***\#Given a non-empty 2D array `grid` of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.***

***Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.)***

***Example：***

```
[[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
 
 return 6
```

### ==Solution：==

1. 同200题，只需加个计数器，每次遍历完所有queue后更新一次最大island数目。
2. DFS/BFS

#### BFS

```python
from collections import deque
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not grid:
            return 0
        row = len(grid)
        colunm = len(grid[0])
        res = 0
        queue = deque()
        for r in range(row):
            for c in range(colunm):
                cur_sum = 0
                if grid[r][c] == 1:
                    grid[r][c] = 0
                    queue.append([r, c])
                    while queue:
                        x, y = queue.popleft()
                        cur_sum += 1
                        for new_x, new_y in ((x + 1, y), (x - 1, y), (x, y + 1), (x, y - 1)):
                            if 0 <= new_x < row and 0 <= new_y < colunm and grid[new_x][new_y] == 1:
                                queue.append([new_x, new_y])
                                grid[new_x][new_y] = 0
                res = max(res, cur_sum)
        return res
```
