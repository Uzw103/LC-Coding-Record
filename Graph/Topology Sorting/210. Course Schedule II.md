\# [210] **Course Schedule II**

**\#*There are a total of `n` courses you have to take labelled from `0` to `n - 1`.***

***Some courses may have `prerequisites`, for example, if `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` this means you must take the course `bi` before the course `ai`.***

***Given the total number of courses `numCourses` and a list of the `prerequisite` pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.***

***If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.***

***Example：***

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
```

### ==Solution：==

1. **同207**，使用拓扑排序，DFS/BFS。判断有无环即可
2. **唯一区别：需要记录下每次queue pop出的边缘结点，即先修课所在的图结点**

        graph = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]

        for course in prerequisites:
            graph[course[1]].append(course[0])
            indegree[course[0]] += 1
        res = []
        queue = collections.deque([n for n in range(numCourses) if indegree[n] == 0])
        while queue:
            cur_course = queue.popleft()
            res.append(cur_course)
            for child in graph[cur_course]:
                indegree[child] -= 1
                if indegree[child] == 0:
                    queue.append(child)
        if len(res) != numCourses:
            return []
        return res
