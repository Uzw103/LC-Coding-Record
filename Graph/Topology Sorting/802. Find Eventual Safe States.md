*\# [802] **Find Eventual Safe States***

***\#We define a starting node to be safe if we must eventually walk to a terminal node. More specifically, there is a natural number `k`, so that we must have stopped at a terminal node in less than `k` steps for any choice of where to walk.***

***Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.***

***The directed graph has `n` nodes with labels from `0` to `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of `graph`. The graph is given in the following form: `graph[i]` is a list of labels `j` such that `(i, j)` is a directed edge of the graph, going from node `i` to node `j`.***

> **大致题意：判断图中是否有环存在，即结点不在环里面，可以exactly到达一个终点，不存在能无限循环下去的可能**

***Example：***

![Illustration of graph](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/03/17/picture1.png)

```
Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
Output: [2,4,5,6]
Explanation: The given graph is shown above.
```

### ==Solution：==

1. **有向无环图问题：拓扑排序**。需要同时建立每个结点的`indegree`和`outdegree`。设置一个最终返回的结点list，并且输出前排序
2. DFS方法

```python
class Solution:
    def eventualSafeNodes(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        length = len(graph)
        outdegree = collections.deque()  # 存放出度为0的结点 即之后没有连接线的结点 一定是终点
        indegree = [[] for _ in range(length)]
        # unsearched = set(list(range(length)))
        for i, direction in enumerate(graph):
            if len(direction) == 0:
                outdegree.append(i)
                # unsearched.remove(i)
                continue
            for j in graph[i]:
                indegree[j].append(i)
        res = []
        while outdegree:
            node = outdegree.popleft()
            res.append(node)
            for i in indegree[node]:
                graph[i].remove(node)
                if len(graph[i]) == 0:
                    # unsearched.remove(i)
                    outdegree.append(i)
        res.sort()
        return res
```
