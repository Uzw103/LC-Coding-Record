\# [841] Keys and Rooms

\#There are `N` rooms and you start in room `0`. Each room has a distinct number in `0, 1, 2, ..., N-1`, and each room may have some keys to access the next room. 

Formally, each room `i` has a list of keys `rooms[i]`, and each key `rooms[i][j]` is an integer in `[0, 1, ..., N-1]` where `N = rooms.length`. A key `rooms[i][j] = v` opens the room with number `v`.

Return `true` if and only if you can enter every room.

Example:

```
Input: [[1],[2],[3],[]]
Output: true
Explanation:  
We start in room 0, and pick up key 1.
We then go to room 1, and pick up key 2.
We then go to room 2, and pick up key 3.
We then go to room 3.  Since we were able to go to every room, we return true.
```

### ==Solution:==

1. **本题关键：将房间出入问题转化为有向图问题，即能否从0号结点访问到达图的所有结点**
2. DFS：创建一个set存放不重复的room房间号，每次递归房间数+1
3. BFS：创建queue，每次queue存放不重复的房间数

#### BFS

```python
class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        # 从0号房间出发，能否到达所有房间
        dic = set()  # 只保存房间号，从0开始，不重复的房间号
        dic.add(0)
        total_room_num = len(rooms)
        cur_room_num = 0
        queue = collections.deque([0])  # 存放不重复的room房间号
        while queue:  # queue遍历几次就有几个room数，所以循环结束就可以判断num是否=题目room数
            room_num = queue.popleft()
            cur_room_num += 1
            for key in rooms[room_num]:
                if key not in dic:
                    dic.add(key)
                    queue.append(key)
        return cur_room_num == total_room_num
```

#### DFS

```python
class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        # 从0号房间出发，能否到达所有房间
        def dfs(room_num):
            nonlocal cur_room_num
            dic.add(room_num)
            cur_room_num += 1
            for key in rooms[room_num]:
                if key not in dic:
                    dfs(key)
        total_room_num = len(rooms)
        cur_room_num = 0
        dic = set()
        dfs(0)
        return cur_room_num == total_room_num
```
