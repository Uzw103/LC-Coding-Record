*\# [997] **Find the Town Judge***

***\#In a town, there are `N` people labelled from `1` to `N`. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.***

***If the town judge exists, then:***

1. ***The town judge trusts nobody.***
2. ***Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.***
3. ***There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.***

***You are given `trust`, an array of pairs `trust[i] = [a, b]` representing that the person labelled `a` trusts the person labelled `b`.***

***If the town judge exists and can be identified, return the label of the town judge. Otherwise, return `-1`.***

***Example：***

```
Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3
```

### ==Solution：==

1. **return：**indegree = N - 1 且 outdegree = 0的结点下标
2. 设置**两个数组**，分别累加indegree和outdegree。<span style='color:orange;background:背景颜色;font-size:文字大小;'>**数组的长度为N+1，方便直接读取trust数组中的值来累加，第一个0位元素在遍历的时候直接跳过** </span>
3. 法二：**设置一个数组**，出度 - 1，入度 + 1，返回数组中值为N - 1的下标即可

\# @lc code=start

```python
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, N: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        indegree = [0 for _ in range(N+1)]
        outdegree = [0 for _ in range(N+1)]
        for i, j in trust:
            indegree[j] += 1
            outdegree[i] += 1
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            # if outdegree[i] == 0 and indegree[i] == N - 1:
            if indegree[i] - outdegree[i] == N - 1:
                return i
        return -1 
```



#### 法二：一个数组

```python
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, N: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        array = [0 for _ in range(N+1)]
        for i, j in trust:
            array[j] += 1
            array[i] -= 1
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            # if outdegree[i] == 0 and indegree[i] == N - 1:
            if array[i] == N - 1:
                return i
        return -1
```
