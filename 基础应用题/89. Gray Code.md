*\# [89] **Gray Code***

***\#An n-bit gray code sequence is a sequence of `2n` integers where:***

- ***Every integer is in the inclusive range `[0, 2n - 1]`,***
- ***The first integer is `0`,***
- ***An integer appears no more than once in the sequence,***
- ***The binary representation of every pair of adjacent integers differs by exactly one bit, and***
- ***The binary representation of the first and last integers differs by exactly one bit.***

***Given an integer `n`, return any valid n-bit gray code sequence.***

***Example:***

```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,3,2]
Explanation:
The binary representation of [0,1,3,2] is [00,01,11,10].
- 00 and 01 differ by one bit
- 01 and 11 differ by one bit
- 11 and 10 differ by one bit
- 10 and 00 differ by one bit
[0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence, whose binary representation is [00,10,11,01].
- 00 and 10 differ by one bit
- 10 and 11 differ by one bit
- 11 and 01 differ by one bit
- 01 and 00 differ by one bit
```

### Solution:

1. 二进制问题：找规律，随着n递增，对应元素的二进制形式是之前list里二进制数在最首位+1的形式

```python
class Solution:
    def grayCode(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        if n == 0:
            return [0]
        res = [0, 1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            for num in res[::-1]:
                res.append(2**i + num) # 因为随着i增加，后面的二进制数只能与其前面的数的二进制数有1个位数的差异 所以只从后往前遍历num
        return res
```
